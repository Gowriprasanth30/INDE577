##  Perceptron model

The perceptron is a basic function that mimics the human neuron. It receives n inputs, associated to the dendrites inputs to the neuron. Each dendrite, due to lernging, is weighted by a number that signals its input relevance for the neuron.

How Perceptron Model Works?

Perceptron Network is an artificial neuron with "hardlim" as a transfer function. It is mainly used as a binary classifier. Here, our goal is to classify the input into the binary classifier and for that network has to "LEARN" how to do that. "LEARN" means the model has to be trained to do so.

For training, the network is provided with a bunch of inputs with already known outputs. As result is already known, the output of a network is compared with the already known results and with the help of the "Perceptron Learning Rules" model get trained.
##  Dataset Used
Divorce prediction dataset from kaggle. Dataset contains numerous questions and based on that divorce prediction is made.
