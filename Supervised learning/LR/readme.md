##  Linear Regression

Before there was any ML algorithms, there was a concept and that was regression. Linear regression is most simple and every beginner Data scientist or Machine learning Engineer start with this. Linear regression comes under supervised model where data is labelled. In linear regression we will find relationship between one or more features(independent variables) like x1,x2,x3………xn. and one continuous target variable(dependent variable) like y.

Once the parameter values i.e bias term and theta1 are randomly initialized, the hypothesis function is ready for prediction, and then the error (|predicted value – actual value|) is calculated to check whether the randomly initialized parameter is giving the right prediction or not.
##  Dataset Used

Random data set from kaggle. Using this data set we are trying to build a LR model and fit the features in our regression line and determing the accuracy scores.
##  Task

Figuring out the relationship between features and class.Finding the accuracy of cleaned data and uncleaned data after training the model and Figuring out the use pre-processing.
