# K Nearest Neighbours:
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970’s as a non-parametric technique.




##  Dataset Used

The data used for this algorithms is a public data from Kaggle “Bordeaux.csv”
## Task

This data has features such as price, summer, har, sep, win, age and using our algorithm to find the price of wine for missing years. We are implementing 2 models for predicting the price.

First model – Using distance formula

Second model – Using scikit packages for KNN.

Comparing the best predicted price is our goal and which model is performing better.
