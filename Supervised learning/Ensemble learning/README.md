# Ensemble Learning
Ensembling is a technique for combining two or more similar or dissimilar machine learning algorithms to create a model that delivers superior predictive power.
ML-Ensemble combines a Scikit-learn high-level API with a low-level computational graph framework to build memory efficient, maximally parallelized ensemble networks in as few lines of codes as possible. ML-Ensemble is thread safe as long as base learners are and can fall back on memory mapped multiprocessing for memory-neutral process-based concurrency. 
Task
In this project, we are going to work on some Housing  dataset, indicating sale price based on the features. The goal is to predicting the price of  house using algorithms as such Linear Regression , KNN and stacking. (Voting regressor)






## Dataset used
The data used for this model is a public data from Github.
http://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/


The data contains the following features:

Gr Living Area - Area of living space

Bedroom – Total number of bedrooms

Overall Quality – Quality of the house

Overall Condition – Condition of the house

Full Bath – Total number of bathrooms
