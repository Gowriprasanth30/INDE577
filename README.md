## Random Forest
  A random forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is constructed from decision tree algorithms. This algorithm is applied in various industries such as banking and e-commerce to predict behavior and outcomes.
A random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees. The ‘forest’ generated by the random forest algorithm is trained through bagging or bootstrap aggregating. Bagging is an ensemble meta-algorithm that improves the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. The (random forest) algorithm establishes the outcome based on the predictions of the decision trees. It predicts by taking the average or mean of the output from various trees. Increasing the number of trees increases the precision of the outcome.


##  Dataset Used
Dataset from kaggle - diabetes.csv 
##  Task
In this project, we are going to work on diabetic dataset, to determine the pregnancy.

The goal is to predict if a pregnant or not based on the features of the user by using the random forest method.
